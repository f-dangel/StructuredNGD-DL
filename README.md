[Code](https://github.com/yorkerlin/StructuredNGD-DL/blob/main/optimizers/local_cov.py) for ICML 2023 paper on [Simplifying Momentum-based Positive-definite Submanifold Optimization with Applications to Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09738)

* Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100
* The dataset should be saved in the "data" folder (i.e., data/imagenet100/)

* Todo:
    * Add code for optimization on SPD manifolds
